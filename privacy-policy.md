### We do not collect any of your data.

We simply allow you to connect to Planning Center through their public APIs using your provided credentials. 
We do not control or have knowledge of any tracking or usage statistics that Planning Center itself keeps. 

Your login is encrypted and sent directly to Planning Center using the OS components, so our app never sees them. The authenication credential returned by Planning Center is stored securely in the Keychain on the device.

This app is a small project and doesn't collect any analytics or usage data. If you discover an issue, please [contact us](mailto:dev.josephvanboxtel+services-scheduler@gmail.com).
