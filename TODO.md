#  TODO Items

- Support Refreshing tokens
- Consider deleting the keychain item when saving fails.
- Consider drag and drop scheduling on the feed.
-    I could have a list of profile photos in a sheet at the bottom. They could be dragged on to needed positions. The needed positions that the held person fits would highlight when dragging the person.
-   Possibly also allow dragging people in the feed to needed positions.
-   WIth the lower sheet visible maybe touching or holding a needed position would highlight or filter the content of the sheet for that postion.
-   This approach might be better fitted for a horizontal paging list instead of a vertical list.
